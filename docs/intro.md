# Tensorfleet Docs

Tensorfleet makes it easier to build, simulate, and operate robots and drones. This site packages the essentials for getting started with our toolchain:

- **VS Code Extension**: A full cockpit for PX4, ROS 2, Gazebo, and mission tooling.
- **Easy Drone SDK**: Pure-Python Gazebo transport with ZeroMQ or Zenoh backends.
- **Example Projects**: Ready-to-run samples that show how to wire up autonomy quickly.

## Who this is for

- Robotics teams shipping PX4/ROS 2 missions.
- Developers prototyping autonomy, perception, and telemetry pipelines.
- Operators who need a single pane of glass for simulation and flight control.

## Quick links

- Start in the editor: [Tensorfleet VS Code Extension](vscode-extension.md)
- Run a working sample: [example-easy-drone-python](example-easy-drone-python.md)
- Build with the SDK: [easy-drone library](easy-drone-library.md)

## Prerequisites

- VS Code (latest stable)
- Node.js 20+ for extension development and Docusaurus
- Python 3.8+ for SDKs and examples
